      "Hello Sky Ryder, we have received your recent lab results. Your HDL level is 40 mg/dL, which is considered low. HDL is often called \"good cholesterol\" because it helps remove bad cholesterol from your bloodstream. Your total cholesterol is 191 mg/dL, which is a little high. Cholesterol is a waxy substance that can build up in your arteries and potentially lead to heart disease. Your triglyceride level is 84 mg/dL, which is normal. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. Your LDL calculated level is 133 mg/dL, which is a little high. LDL is often called \"bad cholesterol\" because it can build up in your arteries and potentially lead to heart disease. Your CHOL/HDL ratio is 4.8, which is high. This ratio is used to assess your risk for heart disease. Your total non-HDL cholesterol level is 151 mg/dL, which is a little high. This level includes both LDL and VLDL cholesterol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on your lab results, it's important to make some lifestyle changes to help improve your cholesterol levels and reduce your risk for heart disease. You may want to consider increasing physical activity, eating a healthy diet, and potentially taking medication to help lower your cholesterol. We recommend discussing your lab results and treatment options with your healthcare provider.\n"
